cryptography

cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and
primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your
"cryptographic standard library". It supports Python 3.7+ and
PyPy3 7.3.11+.

cryptography includes both high level recipes and low level
interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric
ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions.
