img2pdf

Lossless conversion of raster images to PDF. You should use img2pdf if
your priorities are (in this order):

- always lossless: the image embedded in the PDF will always have the
  exact same color information for every pixel as the input

- small: if possible, the difference in filesize between the input
  image and the output PDF will only be the overhead of the PDF container itself

- fast: if possible, the input image is just pasted into the PDF
  document as-is without any CPU hungry re-encoding of the pixel data
