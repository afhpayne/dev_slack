Tesseract OCR

Tesseract is an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine, available
under the Apache 2.0 license.

Tesseract can be used directly via command line, or (for programmers)
by using an API to extract printed text from images. It supports a
wide variety of languages. Tesseract doesnâ€™t have a built-in GUI, but
there are several available from the 3rdParty page. External tools,
wrappers and training projects for Tesseract are listed under AddOns.
