Libvirt Python Binding

This package provides a module that permits applications written in the
Python 3.x programming language to call the interface supplied by the
libvirt library, to manage the virtualization capabilities of recent
versions of Linux (and other OSes).

As such, the module exposes Python bindings to to the libvirt.so,
libvirt-qemu.so and libvirt-lxc.so library APIs.
