Virtual Machine Manager

virt-manager is a graphical tool for managing virtual machines via
libvirt. Most usage is with QEMU/KVM virtual machines, but Xen and
libvirt LXC containers are well supported. Common operations for
any libvirt driver should work.

Note:
As root, start the daemons

libvirtd -d

virtlogd -d

And make sure your user is in the groups kvm and libvirt

sudo groupadd libvirt
sudo useradd -aG libvirt $USER
sudo useradd -aG kvm $USER

You'll need to restart you session or just reboot.
