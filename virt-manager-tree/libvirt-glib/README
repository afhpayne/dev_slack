Libvirt API for virtualization

Libvirt provides a portable, long term stable C API for managing the
virtualization technologies provided by many operating systems. It
includes support for QEMU, KVM, Xen, LXC, bhyve, Virtuozzo, VMware
vCenter and ESX, VMware Desktop, Hyper-V, VirtualBox and the POWER
Hypervisor.

For some of these hypervisors, it provides a stateful management
daemon which runs on the virtualization host allowing access to the
API both by non-privileged local users and remote users.

Layered packages provide bindings of the libvirt C API into other
languages including Python, Perl, PHP, Go, Java, OCaml, as well as
mappings into object systems such as GObject, CIM and SNMP.
