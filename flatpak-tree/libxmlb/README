libxmlb

A library to help create and query binary XML blobs

XML is slow to parse and strings inside the document cannot
be memory mapped as they do not have a trailing NUL char. The
libxmlb library takes XML source, and converts it to a
structured binary representation with a deduplicated string
table -- where the strings have the NULs included.
